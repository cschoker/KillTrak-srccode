*ABOUT THIS MOD*

KillTrak (or Kill Tracker) is a Minecraft mod that... you guess it, tracking kills (similar to StatTrak™ from CS:GO, KillCounter™ in PUBG, Player/Total Kill Counter in Unturned, Snooper in Minecraft etc.) in Minecraft, by killing Mobs, Monsters, etc.

Nothing very much about this mod until furthur development progress :D
But until then, i think this pretty much enough for a newly IT guy like me
